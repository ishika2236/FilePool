# CTRL Intelligence: Decentralized P2P Memory Sharing Platform

Welcome to **CTRL Intelligence**, where we are revolutionizing external memory sharing through decentralization. Our platform allows users to lend out their extra storage space and earn money in return, while others can securely rent this space through **smart contracts**. All transactions are transparent and powered by blockchain technology, and file transfers are peer-to-peer (P2P), ensuring efficiency and security.

We are here to disrupt the traditional cloud storage industry by providing a decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective alternative.

## üåç Vision

Imagine renting out the unused storage on your laptop and earning real money while others access that space securely. That's exactly what CTRL Intelligence enables‚Äîyour extra storage can now work for you. Our platform connects storage providers and renters in a decentralized network where **blockchain-based smart contracts** ensure transparency, fairness, and instant payments.

In the future, we aim to integrate **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) to further reduce storage costs, making decentralized storage more affordable than ever.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Decentralized P2P Storage Sharing**: Users can lend out extra storage space from their laptops or other machines to others in need. The file sharing is handled in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner, ensuring high-speed and reliable transfers.
  
- **Blockchain-Driven Smart Contracts**: Transactions between storage providers and renters are processed through **Ethereum-based smart contracts**, ensuring that payments are transparent, instant, and immutable.

- **Instant Payments**: Storage providers are paid instantly when their space is rented out. The payments are seamlessly handled through the blockchain, eliminating any need for intermediaries.

- **Secure and Private**: All file transfers are encrypted and conducted over secure P2P channels, preventing unauthorized access or data breaches.

- **Future Integration with IPFS**: We plan to integrate **IPFS** for decentralized data storage, reducing costs and making it even more efficient. The estimated cost of storing **80GB of data** could be reduced to less than **$1**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

CTRL Intelligence is built using cutting-edge decentralized technologies and modern development tools to ensure performance, security, and scalability. Here's a look at the technologies powering our platform:

### Blockchain & Smart Contracts
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for automating storage transactions on the Ethereum network.
- **Truffle**: Development framework for testing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain emulator for development and testing purposes.
- **Ether.js**: A powerful library to interact with Ethereum, enabling easy integration between our platform and blockchain transactions.

### Decentralized File Sharing
- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication technology that powers direct file sharing between users in a secure and efficient manner.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time event-driven communication for maintaining a seamless connection between peers in the network.
- **IPFS (Future Scope)**: InterPlanetary File System, a decentralized storage protocol that allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes, reducing costs and improving redundancy.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A modern and flexible JavaScript library for building our user-friendly interface.
- **Web3.js**: Ethereum JavaScript API to interact with smart contracts directly from the frontend.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side platform for handling the business logic of our decentralized network.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API that connects the frontend with the blockchain and P2P protocols.

## üîß How It Works

1. **For Storage Providers**:
   - Install the CTRL Intelligence app and allocate the extra storage space you wish to rent out.
   - When a renter needs space, your available storage is rented automatically via a **smart contract**.
   - You get **paid instantly** in cryptocurrency as soon as the contract is executed and storage is utilized.

2. **For Storage Renters**:
   - Browse available storage space from various providers across the decentralized network.
   - Select the space that fits your needs and pay for it using cryptocurrency through a secure smart contract.
   - Files are transferred **P2P** directly between you and the provider, with no central servers involved.

## üå± Future Scope: IPFS Integration

We are working on integrating **IPFS** to further optimize and decentralize file storage. With IPFS, data is not stored in a single location but is distributed across various nodes. This will significantly reduce costs and increase redundancy, providing users with more affordable and reliable storage options.

Our goal is to reduce the cost of storing **80GB** of data to **less than $1**, making decentralized storage a viable and attractive alternative to traditional cloud services.
